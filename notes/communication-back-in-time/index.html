                <p>Most of the software companies have migrated to the very convenient and cute
messenger, called Slack.</p>

<p>To be the decent man I also liked it for the first time. It gave me the feeling
of involving in the whole company life. I was a superhero observing different
tasks, simultaneously solving different issues.</p>

<p>But once I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s so convenient that I was simply chatting with
the college about random stuff.</p>

<p>In that evening I had a bell ringing in my head that something wrong with the
model that most developers definitely love.</p>

<p>After thinking a while about it I&rsquo;ve remembered how Linux Kernel developers
communicate by using emails to send the patches.</p>

<p>You may think that in 21-century email usage seemed obsolete. Let&rsquo;s see on
this from the other side:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to instantly reply to the message.</li>
<li>The level of distracting is very low.</li>
<li>Zero level of multitasking.</li>
<li>The mailer definitely will think twice and careful before sending the mail.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last thing is very important because it develops the ability to formulate
thoughts. Like Richard Feynman said: &ldquo;You should explain the idea in such way
so it will be understood by the 6 years old child&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Happy hacking and please think slow sometimes.</p>
