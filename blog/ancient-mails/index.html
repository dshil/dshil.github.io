                <p>Most of the software companies have migrated to the very convenient and cute
messenger, called Slack.</p>

<p>To be the decent man I also liked it for a first time. It gave me the feeling
of involving in the whole company life. I was a superhero observing different
tasks, simultaneously solving different issues.</p>

<p>Once I realized that it&rsquo;s so convenient that I was simply chatting with the
college about random stuff. In that evening I had a bell ringing in my head
that something wrong with the model that most developers definitely love.
After that I remember about emails, mailing lists, IRC and other &ldquo;things from
the previous century&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You may think that in 21-century using email seems odd, you&rsquo;re right but let&rsquo;s
see on this from the other side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zero level of multitasking.</li>
<li>No need to instantly reply to a message.</li>
<li>More importantly writing an email slows you down, forces you to stop and
think before sending a letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy hacking and please think slow sometimes.</p>
