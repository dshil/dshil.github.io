      <description>Hello everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer with over 8 years of experience in software development. I have a strong software foundation, including a deep understanding of design and development flows, real-time constraints, concurrency. Throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve specialised in building software systems with critical performance and reliability requirements.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a number of different areas. This has given me a broad perspective on how software is built. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed software for Linux and RTOS environments, with a strong focus on testability and maintainability.</description>

      <description>Preface An internet was designed in a such way that almost nobody remembers the days when there is no internet. People just got used to this phenomenon, like an air, in the same way, there are some people who remember those days and we should protect them as the UNESCO area. This feeling that the internet has been at all times shows that it was very well-designed and later - implemented.</description>

      <description>I always do git log and explore what changes were made by other developers. It is my habit and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect that other developers do the same. But I would totally be very happy if a git history will become more clean and understandable not only in big open-source projects but also in a majority of company in the software development industry. You need to follow some rules to keep your git history healthy.</description>

When it comes to high-resolution time management in OS X wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be a dreamy to have the following routines:
