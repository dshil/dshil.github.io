                <p>I wrote an <a href="https://dshil.github.io/blog/linux-fight-for-better-health/">article</a> about strange headaches that I had. I made an assumption that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>. So, I had decided to overcome this issue. My plan was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a new laptop</li>
<li>Setup all <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight">PWM related settings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Improve_Font_Rendering">Setup fonts + reduce the glare effect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I bought a new laptop, Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon, with a brilliant display. Then I performed all the required setup steps and started to wait if the headaches would be gone. It did not work. I was waiting for 1 month, another month, but headaches were still my best friends and I had no idea what to do with them. The main issue was that I was travelling at that time. I paid for everything. It was too expensive to cancel all. So, I decided to keep my life as is.</p>
<p>Then things got worse. I began to have insomnia. It was the most terrible period of my life. Insomnia started to break all my daily habits. It was hard to plan anything because you may stay up all night and only fell asleep in the earlier morning. I did not know what was the reason for insomnia but I knew exactly that I need to overcome it somehow. It is very difficult to describe the state of constant insomnia to a person who has never suffered from it. Add to this the face of loneliness because of work and travel lifestyle and you got the awful results. I was completely broken. So, I started to take sleeping pills, because I needed to sleep somehow. Well, it helped me to sleep but it made me almost impossible to think. At that point, I could only do routine tasks. I became a walking plant.</p>
<p>I decided to stop my long travelling and move back home. I started going to different ophthalmologists and told them my story. Each time I started to talk about insomnia they said that I chose the wrong doctor and I need to go to the sleep doctor. It went on for a while and one day I meet the required doctor. She made a clever assumption: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_eye_syndrome">dry eye syndrome</a> can be the major problem. We did the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schirmer%27s_test">Schirmer test</a> and got the expected results. My eyes did not produce tears almost all the time and if they produce the tear, it will dry immediately. Dry eye syndrome increases the tension inside the eyes. Sometimes the tension causes headaches and insomnia. So, our goal was to fix the tear release mechanism. I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use tears substitutes during the day;</li>
<li>Use moisturizing eye gel during the night;</li>
<li>Use medications for eyes relaxation (special drops);</li>
<li>Perform eyes exercise twice a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was doing it almost for 3 months and got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insomnia has become rare</li>
<li>Tear release mechanism has improved. I started with zero points for both eyes. At the end of the third month, I had 4 points for the left eye and 6 points for the right eye. It is still not a good result because you should have more than 10 points for both eyes;</li>
<li>I still have headaches during the working day and my current doctor had no idea what to do;</li>
<li>I still can't sit in front of my display longer than 25 minutes without a break.</li>
</ul>
