      <description>Preface For a long time I was working in the office in the front of my lovely Dell 24 Monitor but recently I have been starting working more in front of my laptop. It is MacBook Pro 17 Late 2011, very old guy with Fedora on a board. Suddenly I started having more and more headaches. It was sad and I decided to visit a doctor. Well, we made a tons of analysis, check eyes, check vessels of the brain, check neck and a lot more and surprisingly we did not find anything.</description>

      <description>Preface An internet was designed in a such way that almost nobody remembers the days when there is no internet. People just got used to this phenomenon, like an air, in the same way, there are some people who remember those days and we should protect them as the UNESCO area.
