<p>An internet was designed in a such way that almost nobody remembers the days
when there is no internet. People just got used to this phenomenon, like an air,
in the same way, there are some people who remember those days and we should
protect them as the UNESCO area. This feeling that the internet has been at all
times shows that it was very well-designed and later - implemented.</p>
<p>In those days there wasn't such thing as a revision control system.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">First of them</a> were implemented  not so long ago. As a result modern developers
probably have never encountered the difficulties while working with them.
Probably, some of you remember the story of the Linux Kernel community and
BeetKeeper usage. For most of the developers it was a big pain in the ass.
The Kernel was growing very fast and BeetKeeper was slowing down roughly at
the same speed. One day Linus and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">some guys from the Linux Kernel</a> built their
own version control system and gave it the great name: git - the stupid content
tracker which is the standard de facto in our days. Git also was designed in a
such way that most of the developers don't remember the days when there is no Git.
Git is treated as a perfect knife that will kill any enemy without any problems.
For most projects it is actually the perfect tool to work with and most of the
developers have never faced any problems with it.</p>
<p>Probably one day you will start working on a very large codebase and realize
that simple <code>git diff</code> or <code>git status</code> takes more than 30 seconds and usual
instant feedback loop (make some changes - save - see the changes) will be
broken. You will feel angry because your lovely flow feeling will be broken.
Most of the C++ developers are very familiar with it: start the compilation
and go for a lunch. I was firstly bit by this issue during LibreOffice
development for Windows.</p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>Before tuning any options it is very important to realize what is the initial
problem. Let's begin with an environment:</p>
<h3 id="windows-partition">Windows Partition</h3>
<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10</li>
<li>FS: NTFS</li>
<li>Hard drive: SSD Kingston 480 GB</li>
<li>POSIX-compatible environment: Cygwin</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linux-partition">Linux Partition</h3>
<ul>
<li>OS: Fedora 29</li>
<li>FS: Ext4</li>
<li>Hard drive: SSD Kingston 480 GB</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ntfs-or-ext4">NTFS or EXT4</h3>
<p>I am not an expert in the file system domain and can't properly explain why
there are zero problems with Git on EXT4 file system and there is a huge
performance degradation on NTFS. It doesn't mean that NTFS is worse than EXT4
because it depends on the operations and environments. I have problems with Git
using Cygwin but probably it is not a case. If you are curious about
benchmarking different FS, the following links may be a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Windows-still-use-NTFS-Why-not-ext4-the-file-system-for-Linux-since-it-actively-prevents-disk-fragmentation">Why does Windows still use NTFS? Why not ext4?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-4.7-FS-5-Way">Linux 4.7 - Btrfs vs. EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. XFS vs. NTFS Benchmarks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems">Comparison of file systems</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tuning-time">Tuning Time</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Git is slow on Windows&rdquo; is a very popular topic in internet and there are a
lot of articles describing how to increase the performance of your Git in the
Windows environment. I will just summarize the most important of them.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-git-configuration">Tuning Git Configuration</h3>
<p>There are 3 magic options that should be turned on to solve all your problems,
but before tuning any options ensure that you really have any problems:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global core.fscache true
git config --global gc.auto 256
</code></pre><p>Let's explore what each option does:</p>
<ul>
<li>core.preloadindex enables parallel index preload for operations like <code>git diff</code>.
Defaults to true.</li>
<li>core.fscache enables file system cache. It is useful only for Windows.</li>
<li>gc.auto minimizes the number of files under ./git directory.
Defaults to 6700.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more info: <code>man git config</code> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4485059/git-bash-is-extremely-slow-on-windows-7-x64">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.praveen.science/solution-to-git-bash-is-very-slow-in-windows/">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/Diagnosing-why-Git-is-so-slow">3</a></p>
<h3 id="cygwin-vs-git-for-windows">Cygwin vs Git for Windows</h3>
<p>If your project doesn't depend on the Cygwin environment and you just need the
git, I would highly recomment to use <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git For Windows</a> .</p>
<p>In comparison to Cygwin, Git for Windows doesn't have any performance issue
for a huge codebase and all git commands like <code>git status</code>, <code>git stash</code>,
<code>git commit</code> work very fast.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-development-workflow">Tuning Development Workflow</h3>
<p>When Cygwin is only the choice, you still have some options that will allow
you to speed up your Git workflow. A lot of techniques are described in
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/handle-big-repositories-git">managing large repositories with Git</a> .
I just picked some of them and adopted my development environment in the
following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to clone the repository with the full Git history because it can be
very huge, e.g., for LibreOffice project, <code>git rev-list --count HEAD</code> equals
to 432192 commits. Specify the number of commits you are interested in
by <code>--depth</code> option during the clone. From the other side, the shorter the
history, the less chance of getting the value from the <code>git blame</code> and <code>git log</code>.</li>
<li>No need to run <code>git status</code>, <code>git diff</code> for the top level path of your
repository. You can specify the only changed directory. As a result you
should think carefully about splitting your changes into several commits that
reduce the scope of the changes per commit.</li>
<li>No need to run Git command each time you do some changes (I had this habit,
probably you too), just slow down your development workflow and keep changes
as small as possible that allow you to remember the recent activity.</li>
</ul>
